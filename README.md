## About the project [ðŸ“Œ](#about-the-project-)

This project aims to provide a simple way to annotate HTML with microdata by utilizing *Deep Learning* methods.

The main motivation behind this project is to manage the tedious task of annotating HTML with microdata. Microdata is part of the WHATWG HTML Standard and is used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines greatly benefit from microdata and boost web pages in search results.

This project is made as part of thesis work in Institute of Information Technologies and Intelligent Systems for a bachelor's degree

## Usage [ðŸ“Œ](#usage-)

### Annotate HTML with microdata

HTML used for commands below requires the following minimal structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content -->
  </body>
```

Annotate HTML by passing a URL to the shell command:

```shell
microdata annotate https://example.com
```

or by passing a path to the file with HTML:

```shell
microdata annotate ./path/to/file.html
```

***IMPORTANT:*** *DO NOT* format HTML, when saving it to a file, pass it *as is*.

or by passing HTML directly to the shell command *(NOT RECOMMENDED)*:

```shell
microdata annotate <HTML>
```

***IMPORTANT:*** *DO NOT* format HTML, when passing it directly to the shell command, pass it *as is*.

Set output file with `--output` option:

```shell
microdata annotate ./path/to/file.html --output ./path/to/annotated_file.html
```

Use `--skip <CLASS>,<OTHER_CLASS>` option to skip items that are related to the specified classes:

```shell
microdata annotate ./path/to/file.html --skip Product,Book
```

Various texts may have similar semantic meanings, so for situations where the user already knows 
that certain classes have a high level of semantic similarity with other classes, 
or when the classification of a specific class is not required for other reasons, use this flag.

The confusion matrix below can give you the insight of the usage of this flag:

![Confusion matrix](images/conf_matrix.jpg)

The model can misclassify a lot of entities as products.
You can also see that the model struggles with choosing between the book and movie entities.
This flag can help to avoid this issue.

You can set confidence threshold with `--threshold` option (*NOT RECOMMENDED*). The default value is 0.75.

You can also pass `--save-preprocessed` flag to save the preprocessed HTML to a file.

Following entities are currently supported:

- [X] Product
- [X] Book
- [X] Event
- [X] Hotel
- [X] JobPosting
- [X] Movie
- [X] Recipe
- [X] Restaurant
- [ ] Organization
- [ ] Place
- [ ] Person
- [ ] PostalAddress
- [ ] Creative Work
- [ ] LocalBusiness
- [ ] Painting
